						<p2>I was born and raised an Indian in India. I and my family have migrated to Australia in 2016. I’ve moved to 6 schools throughout my schooling in countries of India, Singapore and Australia.<br><br>
							My education to date has been:<br>
                            <ul>
								<li>2006 to 2020 - Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE).</li>
							</ul>
							<br>
							I’m unique to myself and others by the fact that I love doing everything myself and constantly improving it as much as I can.<br>
							I currently only speak English, Hindi and Telugu since I learnt these growing up.<br>
							A lot of people find it fascinating that I can speak 3 languages! Either way, I would love to try and learn a new exotic language separated from the western world like French, Chinese or Japanese!<br><br>

							Some interesting things about me are:<br>
							<ul>
								<li>I’ve purpose-built a quadcopter for the delivery of liquid manure for crops as part of a school project.</li>
								<li>I’ve successfully completed and earned my Remote Pilot License (RePL Australia) to fly drones with special access to certain areas and limitations.</li>
								<li>I’ve built a precision heavy-lift quadcopter that can lift up to 5 kg of payload with a full carbon fibre body and a GPS module using custom-designed 3D printed components.</li>
								<li>Additionally, I’ve thoroughly learned and fully utilised tools and software such as BetaFlight, iNav Firmware for tasks such as calibration, setup and testing of the GPS module, motors, flight controller and the Electronic Speed Controller (ESC).</li>
								<li>I also absolutely love playing badminton as my favourite sport</li>
								<li>When it comes to my hobbies, I love watching and keeping up with tech news from YouTube channels like Marques Brownlee, Mark Rober and MrWhoseTheBoss.</li>
								<li>Learning DIY, about sports, engineering and theoretical things about the world is one of my favourite pastimes.</li>
							</ul>

                    <p>
                        <p>In this economy-based commerce, my fascination towards IT is how IT influences our society and culture and strives to improve our quality of life.</p>
                        <p>My passion towards IT started while I was building a heavy lift quadcopter, whilst IT has a broad definition, I would say that personally I&rsquo;m fascinated the most by the concept of software and hardware sub-components coming together to create a new interactive interface</p>
                        <p>The wide range of applications a remote quadcopter can bring to the table greatly influenced my decision in choosing a career path, for example</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Delivery of fertilizers and manure remotely and cost effectively</li>
                            <li>Accessing hazardous and unsafe locations for human beings in a safe manner</li>
                            <li>Remote inspections and measurements</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>And, the new ways an unmanned-air-vehicle (UAV) application making head ways into practically all industry sectors everyday</p>
                        <p>I&rsquo;ve chosen to study at RMIT amongst all of the other universities, well for one, it has fantastic reviews from many other such like-minded people as me which made me more confident that I can find myself doing what I love in the near future. And, because I live in Australia and I felt it was best for me to be studying my passion and work towards my goal right from where I&rsquo;m already well established.</p>
                        <p>Though my interests are very wide-ranging in IT, during a study at RMIT I would want to understand and learn what it takes to build IT systems and applications with a compelling user experience.</p>
                        <p>More specifically, good object-oriented programming skills, data management, and reporting, helping me to establish aIT foundation based on fundamentals and best practices.</p>

							According to my 16 Personalities test result, I am a Turbulent Campaigner, meaning a true free spirit and that they are often the life of the party, It also shows that campaigners are less interested in the sheer excitement and pleasure of the moment than they are in enjoying the social and emotional connections they make with others. In a scenario of working with teammates, I think I would be a major candidate/member of the group Since my energy levels are quite high and so is my level of being extraverted. This could make me work better than I usually do just with the fact that I now know I can do a lot better than I think of myself. This is an accurate test.  I think that this was a quite well-established test and critiquing factors for this test from me are almost none. Speaking of which, I think that the test could majorly benefit from having a broader range of factors to compare off of and also be more specific rather than mentioning a character trait and providing a simple description.<br><br>
						</p3>


						<h3>* Learning Style Test *</h3><br>

						<div class="dropdown">
							<button onclick="myFunction1()" class="dropbtn">Screenshot of results ↓</button>

								<img src="images/Learning Style Results.png" height=649 width=720 alt="Learning Style Test Results"><br>
							</div>
						</div>

						<br><br>
						<p3>
							My Learning Style test results show me that I’m a major visual learner and that I get distracted quite easily. I think the description is accurate and relevant to me because, based on my experience, I have noticed that I really do get distracted easily. This could make potential teams who might be looking for a teammate, steer off of me to include in their team if they had to choose. Although I do disagree with the fact that I’m only a 35% auditory learner whereas I think it should be almost or equal to my visual learning style. This could be improved by increasing the mere 20 questions by at least double for the algorithm to get a better understanding of me to represent my scores.<br><br>
						</p3>


						<h3>* Creativity Test *</h3><br>

						<div class="dropdown">
							<button onclick="myFunction2()" class="dropbtn">Screenshot of results ↓</button>
							<div id="myDropdown2" class="dropdown-content">
								<img src="images/Creativity Results.png" height=689 width=1054 alt="Creativity Test Results"><br>
							</div>
						</div>

						<br><br>
						<p3>
							My creativity test score accurately represents my creativity. Comparing myself to others, I have noticed that I’m generally more creative than others my age or level which is also reflected in the results of the test. This could make me work more efficiently and enthusiastically in a team at least with the placebo of these results in the back of my head. When forming a team of my own, I love having teammates with the same or similar attributes as that of myself. This will promote me to find common ground among my other peers even though it might take some time. I find that even if something takes a bit more time than usual, I would still do it if I think it would result in a much better ending. The only thing I disagree with my test results is that my persistence and complexity factor should be at around the 2nd last ring whereas it is now less than the represented average. I would critique that the algorithm should’ve been programmed to specific attributes and factors whereas I think it was developed with a general personality in mind. Either that or they didn’t get enough results to calculate a better average person.<br><br>

					<div class="col-md-offset-0 col-md-12 wow fadeInLeft" data-wow-offset="50" data-wow-delay="0.6s">
					<h3>Overview</h3>
						<p>A community-based Real Estate property management website will be hosted for all residents of Victoria, Australia. All resident owners who either want to buy sell or rent are encouraged to become members and register their interest to buy or rent immediately or at a future date</p>
						<p>The primary purpose is to allow the first opportunity to all members of the local community who have shown expressed interest to buy or rent a property will be notified via email of the availability.</p>
						<p>The eligible community members will also provide professional services like settlement of sale, rental contracts, property inspections etc. for a fee.</p>

					<h3>Motivation</h3>
						<p>On average, there are 10,600 house transfers every quarter in Victoria, Australia alone, per data published by the <a href="https://www.housingdata.gov.au/">Australian Institute of Health and Welfare</a> on behalf of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.housingdata.gov.au/">Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) since March-2002 to Dec-2020</a>.</p>
						<p>It is expensive and time-consuming for homeowners to sell or rent out their properties involving a lot of legal and other procedural nitty-gritty, if an opportunity is available for homeowners to first try within the close/surrounding community members this will greatly help to integrate the community members and also save money in the process.&nbsp;</p>
						<p>Even for 1% of the community members, a service like this will provide a fair initial opportunity to the community members to save on real estate commission and other associated costs and it will be interesting to see how the community integrates with other community members given that Australia is a land of the diverse population from different countries and cultural backgrounds, because in terms of cost savings it&rsquo;s a win-win to both parties involved.&nbsp;</p>
						<p>This community service has a lot of scope to further enhance and introduce more services and monetise, for example:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Eligible members offering conveyancing, legal services</li>
							<li>Eligible members offering home renovation services</li>
							<li>Introducing other marketing services like conducting inspections, auctions, writing property descriptions...</li>
						</ol>

					<h3>Project Description</h3>
						<p>Community Real Estate Management Services (CREMS) will be a responsive website with the following modules and business processes. The description below for each module is not comprehensive and must be elaborated on with details and specifics.</p>
						<p>All data captured relating to users and their properties must be captured in a relational database with data validations to be elaborated.</p>
						<br>
						<h4><span></span><span>Module - About Us</span></span></h4>
						<p>The "About Us" module is a static responsive static web page, describing the purpose and motivation of this service with images and narrative as applicable</p>
						<br>
						<h4><span>Module - Suburb registration (Master module)</span></h4>
						<p>This module will only be accessible to the site administrator and captures valid Victorian suburbs. The administrator will capture only those suburbs whose residents are eligible to become members.</p>
						<br>
						<h4><span>Module - Member Registration and automated email on successful registration</span></h4>
						<p>Member registration module allows users to register themselves by providing personal information and a valid email address.</p>
						<p>The user wanting to register must be residing in one of the Suburbs captured in the Suburb module. Personal information to be collected is the name, full present address per Australian standard, valid email address, and phone number. Will also allow users to choose a secure password per standard.</p>
						<p>Upon providing the above information by the user, an email will be sent to the member email for confirmation, and a second email for successful registration will be sent to the user.</p>
						<br>
						<h4><span>Module - Property registration (Rental and Sale) and automated email on successful registration</span></h4>
						<p>Registered members will be able to capture and upload property details. Along with a valid property address and a maximum 1000 words property description, this module will capture other details as shown in the below picture.</p>
						<p>User should be able to add multiple properties along with a maximum of 10 images, each image is to be a max of 10 MB in size and allowed image formats are jpeg and png.</p>
						<p>User should be able to edit and delete properties and finally allowed to completion upon which an email with property details should be sent for reference and information and only then the property is visible to all other community members and an informational email is sent to all community members</p>
						<p>User should be able to generate a report of all their properties as HTML to be printed to a printer or in a PDF formatted document.</p>
						<br>
						<h4><span>Module - Property Deactivation</span></h4>
						<p>Once the property is to be pulled off the market after a successful transaction or otherwise, the member should be able to delete the property or the property will automatically be marked as inactive and will not be visible to users</p>
						<p>Upon successful deactivation, an automated email is sent to the owners and users for informational purposes</p>
						<br>
						<h4><span>Module - Member feedback</span></h4>
						<p>After a successful sale or rental, an automated email will be sent to both parties involved to capture responses for</p>
						<ol>
							<li>User experience rating 1 to 5</li>
							<li>Optional User experience description</li>
							<li>Overall rating 1 to 5</li>
							<li>Improvement feedback or suggestions</li>
						</ol>
						<p>The above information will be used for future improvements to the community service</p>
						<br>
						<h4><span>Nice to have or future modules</span></h4>
						<ol>
							<li>Payment gateway</li>
							<li>Validating property addresses with google or AusPost via API</li>
						</ol>

					<h3>Tools and technologies</h3>
						<p>As required by a standard responsive website the hardware required will be a PC with 2 GHz processor speed, 8GB RAM with at least 1 TB disk space should suffice</p>
